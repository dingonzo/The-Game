# The-Game
This was my first game that was created using C#


This game is a first-person shooter that uses capsule bodies for players. I added weapons, randomized spawn points, and increased movement and speed. Furthermore, I created the map, login pages, and player HUD using Unity and Visual Studio Launcher. 
I think that this is a great project for beginner game developers. As of now, I will still be finishing this project out on account that it was created hastily. 

The link to the actual game is on itch.io:https://gonzo245.itch.io/the-game.
